# shakil-mdshosen.github.io

Personal website hosted on GitHub Pages with custom domain: **http://shakil.live/**

## üåê Custom Domain Setup

This repository is configured to use the custom domain `shakil.live` through GitHub Pages. The `CNAME` file contains the domain configuration.

### DNS Configuration Required

To make your domain work, you need to configure DNS settings at your domain registrar (name.com):

#### Option 1: Using A Records (Recommended for root domain)
Add these A records for `shakil.live`:
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

#### Option 2: Using CNAME (for www subdomain)
Add a CNAME record:
```
www.shakil.live ‚Üí shakil-mdshosen.github.io
```

### GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. The custom domain should show `shakil.live`
6. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" once DNS propagation is complete (24-48 hours)
