# Quick Setup Guide for shakil.live

## 🚀 Your website is ready! Here's how to make it live:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/shakil-mdshosen/shakil-mdshosen.github.io
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Configure DNS at name.com (5 minutes)
Login to your name.com account and add these DNS records:

**For root domain (shakil.live):**
```
Type: A Record
Host: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A Record  
Host: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A Record
Host: @  
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A Record
Host: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

**For www subdomain (optional):**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: shakil-mdshosen.github.io
```

### Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation (24-48 hours)
- DNS changes take time to propagate globally
- You can check status at: https://whatsmydns.net/#A/shakil.live

### Step 4: Enable HTTPS (after DNS works)
1. Return to GitHub Pages settings
2. Check **Enforce HTTPS** (only after domain works)

**Note:** GitHub Pages automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. You don't need to generate or provide a CSR code.

**If using Name.com's SSL certificate service:**
Since you are not using Name.com hosting, you'll need to generate a CSR code through your hosting provider (GitHub Pages in this case), then copy and paste it into the Name.com SSL certificate field (including the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` text). However, **this is not necessary** as GitHub Pages handles SSL certificates automatically. Please contact your hosting provider for specific instructions on generating your CSR code if needed for other purposes.
